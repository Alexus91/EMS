Good Practices for Project Execution
Use Agile Methodology: Break down tasks into smaller user stories. Prioritize key features based on stakeholder needs (e.g., Admins and Managers).
Version Control: Use Git to track changes and collaborate. Make sure to push your work frequently and create feature branches.
Documentation: Write user stories, API documentation, and code comments to make the system more maintainable.
Security Considerations: Focus on ensuring secure password storage, role-based access, and secure API endpoints.
By following this structure, you'll build an Employee Management System that’s tailored for TechCo Innovations, with specific roles (Admin, Manager, Employee), a robust authentication system, and advanced features like real-time notifications, analytics, and cloud deployment.
